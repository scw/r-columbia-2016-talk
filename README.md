Description
-----------

R is a powerful language for solving data science problems.
By building cutting edge statistical models with R, and
using ArcGIS for visualization and analysis, you can have the
best of both worlds. This session will give you an overview of the
R language, how you can use it to solve data science problems, and
describe to use it with ArcGIS. Come dive into data science.

Building
--------
